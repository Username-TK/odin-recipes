Lol just accidentally deleted a whole thing that was in part a love letter to VIM. Need more practice. Anyway, things I've learned/gotten a better grasp of: Git, VSCode, Terminal.

Navigated over to VSCode to finish writing this because VIM mastery is outside the scope of this project, but def. something to put on the 'learn to do' list.
